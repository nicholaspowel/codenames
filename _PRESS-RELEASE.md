There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Code Names Against Humanity.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > For anyone who likes team games that involve guessing.

## Summary ##
  > It's Code Names, but for terrible people. Or immature people. Or just bored people.

## Problem ##
  > Other versions of Codenames either use the entire dictionary, or they restrict themslves to "Family Friendly" words. We don't role that way, and by default your boards start with words on the more innapropriate side of things. While you can still go the family friendly route, where's the fun in that? Boards can also be chosen by theme.

## Solution ##
  > Create custom boards with your own words, or use the Wordnix API to find words for you (and your twisted friends)!

## Quote from You ##
  > "Who needs real names or humanity when you have Code Names Against Humanity!".

## How to Get Started ##
  > Make two teams. One person from each team is your spymaster. THe spymasters know which tiles belong to which team. Their job is to get their teammates to guess the correct tiles with clues that consist of a single word and a number of tiles related to that way. The first team to go has 9 words to guess, and the second team has 8 words to guess in total. teams alternate guessing. Be careful though, there are tiles that belong to neither team, and at least one of those loses the game for the team that guesses it.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
